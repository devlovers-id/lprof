<h1 align="center"><small>Monitor Tab Help Window</small></h1>

<p><big>LPROF is an open source application that creates ICC profile for cameras, scanners and monitors. <br>
</big></p>

<small><br>
</small>

<h4 align="center"><big>Create a Monitor Profile</big></h4>



<p><big>LPROF can work in two
different modes to generate a monitor profile. The "advanced" mode, that gives accurate
profiles by using hardware devices like X-Rite DP92 or GretagMacbeth EyeOne,
and the "simple" mode, that allow to you build reasonably accurate
profiles without any additional hardware. <br>
</big></p>

<h4 align="center"><big>Building a monitor profile: a coarse approximation</big></h4>



<p><big>Let's build our first monitor profile to check how all this
stuff works. We don't need great accuracy at this point. We want to
calibrate coarsely, just to visually check if all is going OK.&nbsp; First start LPROF.&nbsp; Since we
need only a coarse profile on the "<a href="file:///home/heng/work/lprof/data/help/monitor.html">Monitor Profiler</a>"
tab select the radio button labeled: "I want to build a coarse profile,
giving approximate values".&nbsp; This is selected by default. We
do not need any hardware measurements at this point only a few visual
adjustments. Press the button labeled: "<a href="mon-val.html">Enter monitor values</a>". &nbsp; You will see
the monitor values dialog. <br>
</big></p>

<h4 align="center"><big>Step 1: Set contrast</big></h4>



<p><big>In order to obtain maximum
performance, we need to adjust the physical monitor
controls.
Set contrast to near maximum, (yes, near maximum. This is the
gain of the monitor and we need as much gain as the monitor can deliver).</big><br>
</p>

<h4 align="center"><big>Step 2: Set Gamma and Black Point</big></h4>



<p><big>Now select the "<a href="gamma.html">Set Gamma and Black Point</a>" button.&nbsp; This dialog will help you to set both the gamma and black point for your monitor. </big><br>
</p>

<h4 align="center"><big>Step 4: Set White Point</big></h4>

<p><big>For information on setting monitor White Point see <a href="mon-val.html">Rough Monitor Values</a>. <br>
</big></p>

<p><small></small></p>

<h4 align="center"><big>Step 5: Set Primaries</big></h4>

<small><br>
</small>

<big>Next adjustment is setting the primaries. </big><big>For information on setting Monitor Primaries values see <a href="mon-val.html">Rough Monitor Values.</a></big>
<h4 align="center"><big>Step 6: Make Final Settings and Create Profile</big></h4>



<p><big>Now you can use the "<a href="profile-id.html">Profile Identification</a>"
dialog to fill in the info about your monitor. Although this is not
strictly required, it could prevent a lot of confusion when you have
more than a couple of profiles. Now we are ready to generate our
profile. We must specify the output filename just like you did when
creating a scanner/camera profile.&nbsp; For the name, we could use
"CoarseMonitor.icm".&nbsp; Type in the name and then proceed to generate the profile by pressing
the "Create Profile" button. If all is OK, the status console will show
"Profile DONE!".&nbsp; Let's now check how well the profile is working by eye.
Do this is basically the same way you proofed your scanner profile..</big></p>

<h4><big>Building a Monitor Profile: Using a Hardware Measurement Device.</big><small></small></h4>
<small>
</small></div>



<p><big>To measure your monitor, you need to create a IT8/CGATS measurement sheet file containing XYZ
measurements for several RGB combinations for your monitor.&nbsp; A
sample file of this kind can be found in "data/pics" directory. The
file is
called "sRGB.IT8" and it measures an ideal sRGB monitor. Use this file
as a template for creating your own monitor measurement sheet file. You need
to
change the XYZ values to those read by your measurement device. Don't
put any Lab value, just RGB and XYZ. Please keep the RGB values the
sRGB.IT8 has. Optionally, you can use more patches to assure consistent
color reproduction, but make sure to include at least the ones in
sRGB.IT8.&nbsp; In the "data/pics" directory you will also find
"monitor patches.tiff".&nbsp; This file contains color patches that
correspond to the values used in sRGB.IT8 and it can be used to measure
the RGB values from your monitor.&nbsp; Note that a large number of
gray patches are needed. You can also add as many as you wish, with
more gray patches, you will get better linearization control curves.
You must specify at least 16 gray patches. </big><small><br>

</small></p>



<big>Now we will try this
procedure, if you do not have a measurement hardware device you can use
sRGB.IT8. We are going to generate a sRGB profile,
by using the sRGB.IT8 measurement sheet. Go to the "Monitor Profiler"
tab.&nbsp; Now, we are going to use it in advanced mode. Select the
radio button labeled: "I want to build accurate profile from
measurement sheet".&nbsp; Then press the "..." button located at right of the
edit box labeled "Measurement Sheet".&nbsp; Select in "data/pics"
directory the file called "sRGB.IT8". In the "Output profile file",
select a new file name for your profile.&nbsp; Call it "my_sRGB.icm". I
will use this sample to present another utility, the <a href="checker.html">profile checker</a>. Since the <a href="checker.html">profile checker</a> can understand advanced tags,
we want to include all information in the profile, so select the
"<a href="profile-parms.html">Profile Parameters</a>"
button, and make sure to select "Verbose, store anything" in the
"profile verbosity level" group. Now use the "<a href="profile-id.html">Profile Identification</a>" button and fill the info fields if you want
(again, this is recommended) and press then press the "Create Profile" button. A
new "my_srgb.icm" profile will be created. We will check now how
accurate this profile is. Start the <a href="checker.html">profile checker</a> dialog selecting the "<a href="checker.html">Profile Checker</a>" button.
The <a href="checker.html">profile checker</a> is a tool for inspecting some of profiles
internals. In our case, we want to check the accuracy. <br>
